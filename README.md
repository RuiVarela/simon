## Building
This was coded on a mac, but it should be very portable.
The only dependency needed is [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). They seem to provide releases on their github page.
Just place the .h and .a under `vendor/raylib` and that should take care of it.

```
make
./simon
```
And that is it..
