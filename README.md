## Building
This was coded on a mac, but it should be very portable.   
The only dependency needed is [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). They seem to provide releases on their github page.   
Just place the `raylib.h` and `raylib.a` under `vendor/raylib` and that should take care of it.   

```
make
./simon
```
And that is it..
